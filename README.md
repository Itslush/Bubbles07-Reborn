# **Continuance**

> (Formerly Bubbles07-Reborn)

Bubbles-07 was an old project that [Guest257351](https://github.com/Guest257351) open sourced 2 and a half years ago, that I've decided to rewrite from Python to C# in a CLI environment ~~(because I dont trust myself with UI on winforms and time crunch)~~.
This project is meant for Operation: TCD to auto-verify our alt accounts. May be useful for the future for other games with alt detection. ~~This has been **insanely** rushed.~~

For the future of this small passion project, I'm considering making an alternative application to [Roblox Account Manager](https://github.com/ic3w0lf22/Roblox-Account-Manager) made by [icewolf](https://github.com/ic3w0lf22/Roblox-Account-Manager).
