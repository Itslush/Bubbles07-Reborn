# **Continuance**

> (Formerly *Bubbles07-Reborn*)

*Continuance* is a rewrite of *Bubbles-07*, an older project originally created in Python by [Guest257351](https://github.com/Guest257351) and open-sourced over two years ago. This new version is being developed in C# as a command-line interface (CLI) application.

The primary purpose of this project is to support *Operation: TCD* by providing an automatic method of verifying the accounts for [Criminality](https://www.roblox.com/games/4588604953/). It may also prove useful for managing accounts in other games with alt detection in the future.

**Future Goals**

Looking ahead, consideration is being given to expanding *Continuance* into an alternative to the *Roblox Account Manager* application developed by [ic3w0lf22](https://github.com/ic3w0lf22) ([Project Link](https://github.com/ic3w0lf22/Roblox-Account-Manager)).
