# Bubbles07-Reborn

An old project by [Guest257351](https://github.com/Guest257351) that was open sourced 2 and a half years ago, that I've decided to rewrite from Python to C# in a CLI environment (because I dont trust myself with UI on winforms and time crunch).
This project is meant for Operation: TCD to auto-verify our alt accounts. May be useful for the future for other games with alt detection. This has been **insanely** rushed.
